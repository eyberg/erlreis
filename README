erlReis

What is this?
-------------
An erlang client to access the geonames api.

Why are you doing this?
-----------------------
this has started as a learning experiment for me with erlang
it might change depending on my time and desire

What's up with the name?
------------------------
Every software project has to have a decent name right? ;)
Piri Reis was a Turkish admiral/cartographer who may have
mapped Antartica three centuries before it was officially
discovered.

How does this work?
-------------------

1) start up erl
    
    [user@host] $ erl

2) compile our code

    Erlang (BEAM) emulator version 5.6.2 [source] [64-bit] [smp:2] [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

    Eshell V5.6.2  (abort with ^G)
    1> c(geonames.erl).

3) start the web server
    
    2> inets:start().
    ok

4) run our function

    3> geonames:city_from_zip("zipcode").
